# Long Live Trumpissimus

For some reason my Mother wanted a random text generator that generates a mixture of P.G. Wodehouse and Donald Trump for her birthday.

Here it is. I've thrown in a few more sources for fun.

Happy birthday Mum.

## Data
 - [P.G. Wodehouse texts from project gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/783)
 - [Trump speeches from ryanmcdermott](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/trump-speeches)
 - Metallica's Lyrics
 - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
 
## Overview

Text is generated via a simple Markov chain, trained on word tri-grams. 

Everything is generated in the browsers, so you may experience a few seconds lag when loading a new source.
